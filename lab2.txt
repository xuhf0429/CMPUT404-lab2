Q1.Make a socket using the line of code "new_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)";and then connect to the google host with proper host and port using the line "new_sock.connect((host, port))" in the main function.
Q2.Client socket is created to call connect() method to connect its IP address and port to a server; server socket is created to call bind() method to bind its host address and port and call listen() method to listen for a connection.
Q3. SO_REUSEADDR inside setsockopt method allows the system to reuse the identical bind port because with it, every time as the program runs, it always gets the same local bind port.
Q4.It outputs the IP address and the port number
Q5.It returns data with 0 bytes.
